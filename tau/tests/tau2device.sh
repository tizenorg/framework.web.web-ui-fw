# This script builds framework rpm using gbs and installs them on target device.
# How to use:
#   run ./tau2device.sh
#   or
#   run ./tau2device.sh <device_serial_number>
#
# IMPORTANT: before use please provide path to rpm's in RPM_SRC variable
#
# If there are some problems with RPM installation, please try to remove
# old packages on target device before instalation.
# To remove packages run following command in target device shell:
# rpm -e <package_name>
# e.g. rpm -e web-ui-fw-theme-tizen-black-0.2.83-1.1.redwood8974xx.noarch

# Defines target device.
# If multiple target devices are connected you can specify it by passing
# target's serial number as argument;
# ./tau2device.sh <device_serial_number>
#
# Define target as '-s <serial_number>' to specify default target
# that is connected or leave it empty if only one target is connected.
# e.g. TARGET="-s emulator-11101"
